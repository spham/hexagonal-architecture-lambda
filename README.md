# Hexagonal Architecture Example (Sample)
Basic overview how to use hexagonal architecture with AWS Lambda

* **Domain model (Core Logic):** does not depend on any other layer; all other layers depend on the domain model.

* **Ports (Use Case):** are the medium through which business logic is accessed. Port is a use case boundary i.e. Ports correspond to use-cases in the application. Simplest implementation of a Port can take form of an API / Facade layer (Fa√ßade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use). A port is a consumer agnostic entry and exit point to/from the application. In many languages, it will be an interface (set of functions).
	* **Primary Port:** Primary ports are the main API of the application. They are called by the primary adapters that form the user side of the application.
	* **Secondary ports:** are the interfaces for the secondary adapters. They are called by the core logic. An example of a secondary port is an interface to store single objects. This interface simply specifies that an object be created, retrieved, updated, and deleted. It tells you nothing about the way the object is stored.
		* Examples: methods e.g. saveToDatabase(), sendEmailToCustomer(), convertFile()

* **Adapters:** act as a layer which serve the purpose of transforming the communication between various external actors and application logic in such a way that both remain independent **(parsing incoming event object & building response)**. In hexagonal architecture all the primary and secondary actors interact with the application ports through adapters.
	* **Primary adapter:** is a piece of code between the user and the core logic. One adapter could be a unit test function for the core logic. Another could be a controller-like function that interacts both with the graphical user interface and the core logic. The primary adapter calls the API functions of the core logic.
	* **Secondary adapter:** is an implementation of the secondary port (which is an interface). For instance, it can be a small class that converts application storage requests to a given database, and return the results of the database in a format requested by the secondary port. It can also be a mock database object needed to unit tests certain parts of the core logic. The core logic calls the functions of the secondary adapter.
		* Examples: 
			* REST Adapter Web API - interacts with events from AWS Gateway
			* SQL Adapter - interacts with Aurora
			* DynamoDB Adapter - interacts with DynamoDb
			* Email adapter - interacts with emailing system
			* Mocking adapters - You can also have a flat file adapter in case data needs to be persisted in text files and also an adapter for Mocking database for testing which just sits in the memory and acts as database.
		
## Hexagonal Architecture Flow

1. An instance of the application is created, as well as the adapters.
2. The secondary adapters are passed to the core logic (dependency injection).
3. The primary adapters receive a link to the core logic. They start to drive the application.
4. User input is processed by one or more primary adapter(s) and passed to the core logic.
5. The core logic interacts with the secondary adapters only.
6. Output of the core logic is returned to the primary adapters. They feed it back to the user.

## Some Other Details

* Dependency injection is used to pass the secondary adapters to the core logic
* Secondary ports are implemented as interfaces. Secondary adapters implement these interfaces.
* You could create a factory for adapters for a given service.
